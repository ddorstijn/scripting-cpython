# BeanShell Scripting

This library provides a
[JSR-223-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scripting_for_the_Java_Platform)
scripting plugin for [Python](http://www.python.org/). In contrast to the
[Jython support](https://github.com/scijava/scripting-jython), this library
accesses CPython (i.e. native Python) via JNI.

It is implemented as a `ScriptLanguage` plugin for the [SciJava
Common](https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common) platform, which means that
in addition to being usable directly as a `javax.script.ScriptEngineFactory`,
it also provides some functionality on top, such as the ability to generate
lines of script code based on SciJava events.

For a complete list of scripting languages available as part of the SciJava
platform, see the
[Scripting](https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/wiki/Scripting) page on
the SciJava Common wiki.

## How to build in Eclipse

You will need to build it from the command-line once, to generate the
`NarSystem` class. This implies that a C compiler needs to be found on the
command-line and that `python.h` can be found by the compiler.

After that, open the context menu of the just-imported Maven project in Eclipse,
select `Properties` and then, in `Java Build Path` click on the `Source` tab
and link the folder `target/nar/nar-generated/` in your project directory that
was just generated by the [NAR plugin](http://maven-nar.github.io/).
